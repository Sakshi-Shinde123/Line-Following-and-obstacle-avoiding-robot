# Line-following-and-obstacle-avoiding-robot
Itâ€™s an autonomous line following robot which also knows to avoid obstacles in the path without human supervision.
Requirements
4 Wheeled Robo chassis
4 gear Motors
12V Li-ion battery
Motor driver L298N - to control the robot speed, direction etc
Arduino UNO - the microcontroller which controls the robot and sensors using the code
Ultrasonic sensor - it detects the distance of the obstacle
2 IR sensors - it detects the path
SPST 2 pin on off switch
jumper wire

After assembling the robot and uploading the code,
place the robot on the path and watch the robot follow the path, detect the obstacle and avoid the obstacle and return back to the path autonomously.
